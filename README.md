# Virtual Pet Shelter

Created an interactive Virtual Dog Shelter. User can select to feed, water and play with a dog.
They also have the ability to adopt or bring in a dog.The dog's current status updates when the user makes an action.
This allows them to make another selection and continue volunteering at the Virtual Shelter. Until they decide to exit.
